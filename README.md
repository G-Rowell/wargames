# Wargames

This repository is a working space & information resource for various wargames.

The aim is to understand LINUX based systems, networking, shell scripting & LaTeX typesetting.

## Structure

Each wargame has it's own folders, with a LaTeX PDF summarising each level.

There are also shell scripts that execute the commands used to solve each level.

## Games

[OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
+ [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

## Requirements

The scripts use sshpass to supply the passwords to the ssh connection,
on Debain based systems run:
```
sudo apt install sshpass
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:G-Rowell/wargames.git
```

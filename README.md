# Wargames

This repository is a working space & information resource for various wargames.

The aim is to understand LINUX based systems, networking, shell scripting & LaTeX typesetting.

## Structure

Each wargame has it's own folders, with a LaTeX PDF summarising each level.

There are also shell scripts that execute the commands used to solve each level.
